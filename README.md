This is Simple Rendering Engine done in Vulkan using C++. Most of the code is from Youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR

On 2dVulkan branch there is simple ball collider simulator.
On ImguiIntegrated I tried to connect I'm GUI to my preexisting code, but I haven't really managed to make to work properly.
